# Commit-Browser #

A little project I made in visual studio 2017 it's based off of Internet explorer I made sure it doesn't use the history and theres a little secret, if you click on the little commit browser icon it will open up another menu giving you more details about the program. Another cool feature is I added a feature so when you hit enter on your keyboard it will navigate to the site of your chosing although it breaks when you hit it and there is nothing in the search bar.
