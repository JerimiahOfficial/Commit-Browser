A little project I made in visual studio 2017 it's based off of Internet explorer I made sure it doesn't use the history and theres a little secret, if you click on the little settings icon it will open up another menu giving you more details about the program. Another cool feature is I added a feature so when you hit enter on your keyboard it will navigate to the site of your chosing although typing in an incorrect webpage it will say can't reach website you can just enter in another one and get on with your day, I hope you appreciate this as I put very little time into it.

p.s Please don't use this for commercial use this is here so people can learn off.
